# Lake-Region-Data-Analysis-Social-audit-Report
Did data entry, cleaning,analysis and detailed reporting on a survey done in TVETS in Siaya and Kakamega County 2024, on behalf of Transparency InternationaI Kenya.
The aim of the social audit was to determine the impact of public participation (students, teachers, parents, citizens) on service delivery in VTCs in Siaya and Kakamega counties.
Raw data collected was presented to my team and I, where we did data entry, cleaning, analysis, visualizations and reporting.
The report concludes by offering recommendations for improvement , to positively and significantly influence service delivery.
